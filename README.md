# MUSIC: The Personal Audio System of Antonio Rodriguez (aka Beastiex)

Welcome to `FORGE/MUSIC/` — my self-hosted, version-controlled, fully automated music system.

This is more than a project. It’s a creative engine — a digital studio, archive, and publishing system for everything I make as a musician, guitarist, and producer.

All content here is original and handcrafted: riffs, beats, short songs, tabs, MIDI, video, presets, and metadata.

## 🎯 Purpose

This system was built to:

- Archive and share my music: guitar riffs, beats, songs, videos, and more
- Automate playlist creation, metadata generation, and validation
- Apply systems thinking and coding to creative output
- Create a sharable, open, and negotiable music platform
- Build a legacy of structured, reproducible art
